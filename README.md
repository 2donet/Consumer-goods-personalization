# Consumer-goods-personalization
Creating both:
System for personalizing consumer goods: User selects graphic from a shop or uploads own; chooses on what to print it (from stores from all over the world), service that is going to print it, and courier service: if every side agrees to the order it starts being prepared.
Rules and system for democratic business project development where work would be rewarded with shares: more 


### Introduction
* People enjoy personalization
* Printing houses have limited goods in stock
* Companies taking care of inputting graphics on clothes, office supplies, cups, etc. have only a couple of different models of e.g. pen. It is understandable as even the biggest warehouses can't manage to store every single pen that is manufactured. Creating a supply chain system for delivering goods chosen by the consumer from another shop straight to printing house would broaden choices and improve satisfaction. Although there are many risks of failure (e.g. by printing house refusing to print on a specific material), a proper review system would maximize the chance of success.
* Courier companies are eager to transport.
* Many people are interested in selling their graphic designs - not only graphic designers, but also YouTubers, musicians, filmmakers, and other artists sell their merchandise. There are many services outsourcing storing, printing, and delivery, but they offer limited models and printing options.
* Corporations often use office supplies with their branding
* Marketing and HR departments would be interested in being able to browse multiple different models of accessories, upload their graphics, and order samples in one place with a couple of clicks.
